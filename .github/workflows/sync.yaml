# GitHub Actions workflow file to sync an external repository to this GitHub mirror.
# This file was automatically generated by go-github-sync.
#
# The workflow does the following:
# - Runs on a scheduled basis (and can also be triggered manually)
# - Clones the GitHub mirror repository
# - Fetches changes from the primary external repository
# - Applies those changes to the mirror repository
# - Pushes the updated content back to the GitHub mirror
#
# Authentication is handled by the GITHUB_TOKEN secret provided by GitHub Actions.
